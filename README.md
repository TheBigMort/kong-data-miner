# kong-data-miner
Mines data for Rumble Kong League NFTs. The code in the main.py file 
was written by Adil Moujahid and modified by me, TheBigMort.

Rumble Kong League is an NFT project. Each Kong NFT has 4 stat boosts
ranging from 0-100 each. Rarity.tools data on boosts wasn't comprehensive
enough so I made this program to mine data and to store the data in a
spreadsheet that can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/
d/1Jvd9I3lXRfllzdRJlWo9tHh5-LrvWDXowhUmG64Bsn4/edit?usp=sharing

As you can see, the main program was modified to only pull and update sale
data but it can also mine other attributes as well. I modified it to
only mine sale data to cut down the time to run the program and update
the google sheet. 

The programs within this project are sloppy and werent cleaned up so there
may be extrenuous bits throughout.
